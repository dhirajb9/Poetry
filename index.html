      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Dhiraj Bhattacharjee, a senior at Rutgers Business School. I began writing poetry to prioritize connection and human emotion. For me, poetry has developed into a means of expressing what is frequently left unsaid. If even one person has felt seen, understood, or inspired through my words, then I’ve done what I set out to do. My poems are pieces of who I represent—guarded, honest, and always reaching for something real. Feel free to reach out via the contact form if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to talk.

        <h2>The Unsaid</h2>
        <p>Your eyes speak in silence
a vivid storm beneath calm waters
while your mouth tells stories
with words that don't match the rhythm.
One whispers truth,
the other wears a mask,
and I can't decide which to trust
the calm or the voice

      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Rhythm is a dancer</h2>
        <p>Rhythm is a dancer, flowing deep as in
a feeling where words cannot begin,
Moving through the heart, touching the soul,
bringing us together, as a whole.
A story must be told
Countless traits, fearless and bold,
A language of passion in every assist
With pace and power, no one can resist
</p>

        <h2>For Him</h2>
        <p>He is my safety net,
he lost the right to fall himself.
Sacrificing his own peace for my benefit,
his exhaustion shows in the lines of his face.
knowing mistakes weren’t an option,
He always takes the hit,
so that I could have a better life.

“Slowing down feels selfish,”¹
Like the world might crumble
The gaze in his eyes–
speaks of dreams deferred,
of battles fought in rooms no one sees.
And I wonder if he knows
he deserves a chance to ease,
to not take the hit,

With me being the safety net this time.
Thank you for having my back, brother.

        <h2>When Winds Speak</h2>
        <p> Fierce winds engrave the sky with grace.
 A vortex of chaos, relentless in its chase.
 Majestic in its fury, the air and debris dance,
 Pulling lightning to the core — you only have one chance.
 Sheer wonder turns to ruin in the blink of an eye,
 A town erased beneath a shattered sky.
 After, only silence remains, Destruction has landed.
 The lens caught chaos — unfiltered, candid.</p>

      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Screaming Silence</h2>
        <p> Are promises just words,
 or were they ever meant at all?
 That’s why I started questioning them,
 they taste too much like comfort,
 like reassurance dressed as truth.
 Actions—
 they scream what words only whisper.
 Not in tone,
 not in volume,
 not in pitch,
 but in reflection.
 In what lingers.
 In what’s missing when the moment passes.
 Most were never followed through.
 Some never even spoke.
 Just bandages
 on wounds that never closed,
 still warm, still bleeding—
 still burning for something real.
 And yet,
 I can respect the silence more than a lie.
 Because silence, at least,
 doesn’t pretend to promise.
 It’s a small step forward,
 the one it takes to finally stop pretending.
 It ends up dragging me two steps back,
 but I’ll always respect what’s done
 more than what’s spoken.

        <h2>Wake up Call</h2>
        <p>Was it giving up, or finally waking up?

We stopped knocking on a door,
a door that never opened.
Not from weakness,
but from wisdom.

We weren’t chosen, just tolerated.
So we let go, not out of defeat,
but because our spirit refused
to starve in waiting.

We moved on—
not because we wanted to,
but because we had to.

We grew in the absence of light.
Learned that persistence
isn’t always the key,
and that’s okay.

We accepted the truth.
And that was bold of us.
A decision well made.
A choice our future selves would be proud of
We have been woken

        <h2>Their Dream, My Flight
</h2>
        <p>They were kids who never stopped growing,
traded dreams for hardships in a foreign country,
gave up language, 
gave up comfort,
left behind family,
to build futures they couldn't see.

Parents who worked so hard,
selfless, silent,
sacrificed careers
so we could chase ours.

I see the kid in them still,
hidden behind tired eyes
and hands too full 
with work they loathe,
missing time, but never love.

If they had what I have,
they’d fly ten times higher.
They took the biggest risk,
Now I owe them something beautiful.

        <h2>Made to Mold</h2>
        <p>To become the fire, I had to burn the past,
the one overcome with many emotions.
I let go of laughter that rang hollow,
shed layers of comfort, stitched by fear.

The vision cracked when I stopped nodding yes,
and in that shatter, I found a voice,
not yet shaped, but meant to mold.

It was left to dry,
so the boy who walked
could lead the man to run.

        <h2>Those unheard</h2>
        <p>They told him to stay quiet
that peace blooms in silence, not in fire.
With no other choice,
But his hands grew tired of praying politely,
while violence diverges beyond the movement.
They call it rage, he calls it his last chance,
a shout no one heard until glass shattered.
His voice was filled with desire,
but you only listened when it shook the streets.
A riot isn’t chaos, it’s a language,
So those unheard will be heard forever

      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Trust</h2>
        <p>Trust sat between us,
and ended with conflict
silent and broad
a weak glass bridge
suspended over everything we built.

One slip.
one lapse of concentration
A moment so brief,
even time could forget
but I never would

Rain fell that day.
Not just from the sky,
but from everything we promised.
Plans dissolved in silence,
a future blurred at the edges.

Your voice said sorry.
But your eyes,
your eyes couldn’t meet mine.

And I learned then:
when trust breaks,
the word “sorry”
is just a sound
trying to reach
something already lost.

        <h2>Mother</h2>
        <p>You came here with empty hands,
but carried the weight of a future unseen—
a foreign land, unfamiliar words,
and two sons you refused to let fall behind.

You did the things you didn’t want to do,
day after day,
waking before the sun,
working jobs that swallowed your joy,
but never your hope.
You carved a path through stone
just so we could walk on memory foam

You gave time you didn’t have,
energy you couldn’t spare.
Your body tired, your heart relentless.
Even as cancer tried to fight,
you fought harder
proof that resilience was defined in the dictionary with your name
<meta name = "jsemail-key" content="shKYIhQDnaEjtCR1U">
We never went hungry,
even when you had nothing left,
you made something warm from scraps
and love from thin air.
My room, always made.
My mess, always gone.
I didn’t make it easy for you,
But you always accepted the challenge

You never forgot the small things
How my day was, the snack I wanted, 
And the smallest detail from our conversation
You remembered us
even when the world forgot you.

And through it all,
you never asked for thanks.
You only gave.
I looked in the mirror
And see the gift you gave me
A reminder to never give up

I love you, Mother.

        <h2>My captain</h2>
        <p>You arrived when the ground beneath us
was already cracking
a club unsure of its own shadow,
a fanbase holding its breath.

And yet, you walked in
like silence before a storm,
eyes set on something higher,
feet firm in foreign soil.

You didn’t ask for trust.
You earned it
not with words,
but with how you spoke with the ball
how you carried weight
that wasn’t yours to bear
but you did it anyways

Some wear the armband.
You wore belief.
there was a new meaning
behind a ship that was sinking
and carrying it to sail
watching it with my own eyes

In a place where glory once echoed,
you echoed something louder
than banners or chants:
through the rough patches
through no rest
Even if no one claps.
Even if we fall again.

You played like the badge was stitched to your skin—
not your shirt.
And I watched,
not just as a fan,
but as someone learning
what it means to lead
without needing the light.

We failed you at times.
You never failed us.

If the sun ever rises again over Old Trafford,
it will be because of the way
you kept the flame burning
when everything else went dark.

You didn’t just play.
You stayed.
you will bring glory
deserving of all the best trophies
And in staying
A statue built in your name
A legend of my beloved football club

        <h2>Fragile Connections</h2>
        <p>Our generation is lonelier than ever,
scrolling past souls like reels,
taught to cut at the first red flag,
forgetting connection was never built on perfection.
Courtesy feels foreign now,
Patience, a language we no longer speak.

Some friendships are worth the ache,
worth sitting in the quiet discomfort,
worth saying I was the problem,
Maybe the red flags we run from
are stitched to our own hands.

We treat people like posts,
unfollow, unfriend, delete; gone
as if hearts don’t break
Companionship needs boundaries,
but it also needs leniency,
the kind that says stay,
when every voice in your head says go.
</p>
      </article>
      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Control</h2>
        <p>In the war of egos,
The loser will likely win.
To swallow pride
is tasting a different kind of power.

An ego kept close,
like fire in a candle,
can light your path,
but give it time,
Let it spread
and it burns everything you love.

Control your storms,
Control your outbreaks
for the one who masters inner calm
stands with the truest crown
</p>
      </article>
      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Saying No</h2>
        <p>The word no holds weight
More than others
on the back of their tongue,
a stone they’re scared to throw.
Left in the back pocket
What if it makes them leave?

But there's a line between kindness
and prioritizing others
They owe themselves the courage
The pride, the power
to be both gentle and unmovable,
to say no without hesitation
No apology needed
and watch who still stays.
</p>
      </article>
      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Father</h2>
        <p>You were one out of fourteen,
Born with companionship, 
Fled seas to conquer comfort,
Leaving everyone behind.
It took me a while to see your struggle,
And now I understand why you acted
The way you did.

You gave when you had nothing left,
carved time out of a day already full,
so I could live easier.
And still, I didn’t always see it.

I wasn’t always who you hoped I’d be.
I pushed back, questioned,
took more than I gave.
But you stayed—
Strong and unshaken.

All you ever wanted
was for me to do better than you.
And now, with every step I take,
I have one thought in mind
All I need is time

I love you, Father

        <h2>Faith</h2>
        <p>There were days I clamped my hands,
not in faith, but confusion—
asking a figure above if I was even heard
I was told I was always being heard
Why did doubt speak louder than feeling?

Temples felt far, felt like a stretch
and rituals slipped through my teeth
like a language I forgot how to believe in.
With words I couldn’t recite

I questioned where I was
But then I found a sudden peace
And I asked
if they knew what it felt like
to walk through fire without becoming hot?

But time taught me this:
It doesn’t always look like peace.
I was never alone
A hand guiding me through it all
a plan, not mine,
but made for me.
I never doubted again
</p>

        <h2>Born and Bred</h2>
        <p>You wore the badge like a second skin,
not always the name they praised,
but always the storm behind the silence.
They doubted your feet,
but never your fire.

Thrown into battles not yours,
positions you didn’t ask for,
you gave everything anyway—
blood, sweat,
The part stats would never count.

Twenty-two years of red
wasn’t just time,
it was belief,
a boy becoming a part
on the pitch he loved.

Now in Naples,
you breathe differently—
not louder, but freer.
You are the proof
that leaving isn’t quitting—
it’s becoming.

        <h2>Never Enough</h2>
        <p>The applause fades faster 
than the silence that it leaves behind,
He cross finish lines 
only to draw new ones—
every triumph tastes like a preview
of the next hunger.

Success feels like a dream he outgrew
the second he woke into it.
But he forgets
there was a version of him
five years ago, knees to floor,
begging for exactly this.

Now he watches me pray again—
not out of ingratitude,
but because he taught me
how to never stop becoming.
Yet he was not satisfied
And the question is
Will he ever be?
</p>

      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Spring</h2>
        <p>Spring feels like a second chance—
like the earth forgives itself
for going cold too long.

The air speaks in color
before words remember how.
The contrast in mellow rainy days
To moderately cool evenings
Even silence hums softer
when nature begins to breathe.

I love it most
because nothing asks why it bloomed
it just does,
as if it always knew
It was worth the wait.

      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Eclipse</h2>
        <p>He handed you the light
before he learned how to hold it.
Let your needs eclipse mine
because caring, to him
meant fading into silence

But silence is not devotion—
its erasure.
Your absence taught me
what presence never could:
that he was never meant
to shrink for someone else's comfort.

Now he speaks in full volume
even when no one listens.
Because he was not made
to be someone else's lesson.
</p>
      </article>
      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Hidden flame</h2>
        <p>Maybe he was kind all along—
just wrapped in sharp edges
so no one mistook him for soft.

Smiles felt like open doors
and he’d seen too many storms walk in.
So he has learned to frown,
to speak in colder tones,
to armor the warmth
that still flickered beneath.

Kindness doesn’t mean open hands—
Sometimes it hides to survive.
</p>
      </article>
      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Resistance</h2>
        <p>He retraced every thought
like Galileo watching stars shift,
their stillness never fooled him.
They begged him to stay silent,
said his mind spun too fast.
But gravity doesn’t ask for belief.
It just is.
He was labeled restless, relentless
when all he did was see
what they weren’t ready to face.
</p>

      <article class="poem">
        <h2>What You Carry</h2>
        <p>You don’t talk about it much anymore,
but it’s still there.
Not loud,
Not pronounced
just tucked between moments,
in the way you pause before speaking,
or how you look away
when a certain name floats by.
Or a certain moment comes back alive

You’ve learned not to be bothered
to smile through it,
to call it “growth”
even when it still aches
like memory etched in muscle.
Time didn’t erase it.
It just taught you
how to hold it without weight
Some things you don’t get over—
you just learn to carry
without letting them hold you.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="poem">
        <h2>Up And Downs</h2>
        <p>Some days lift you gently—
others drag you into the ground
But even the fall
teaches you something
that flight never could.

You’ve broken in pieces
that now hold the strongest parts of you.
Reshaped into something new
like sand crossing paths with fire
only to come out clearer.

Nothing is wasted
not the ache,
not the silence,
not the nights you begged for a reason.

It wasn’t chaos.
It was purpose
And you?
You were always meant to be
Shining brighter than the glass just made
