      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Dhiraj Bhattacharjee, a senior at Rutgers Business School. I began writing poetry to prioritize connection and human emotion. For me, poetry has developed into a means of expressing what is frequently left unsaid. If even one person has felt seen, understood, or inspired through my words, then I’ve done what I set out to do. My poems are pieces of who I represent—guarded, honest, and always reaching for something real. Feel free to reach out via the contact form if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to talk.

        <h2>The Unsaid</h2>
        <p>Your eyes speak in silence
a vivid storm beneath calm waters
while your mouth tells stories
with words that don't match the rhythm.
One whispers truth,
the other wears a mask,
and I can't decide which to trust
the calm or the voice

        <h2>Rhythm is a dancer</h2>
        <p>Rhythm is a dancer, flowing deep as in
a feeling where words cannot begin,
Moving through the heart, touching the soul,
bringing us together, as a whole.
A story must be told
Countless traits, fearless and bold,
A language of passion in every assist
With pace and power, no one can resist

        <h2>For Him</h2>
        <p>He is my safety net,
he lost the right to fall himself.
Sacrificing his own peace for my benefit,
his exhaustion shows in the lines of his face.
knowing mistakes weren’t an option,
He always takes the hit,
so that I could have a better life.
“Slowing down feels selfish,”¹
Like the world might crumble
The gaze in his eyes–
speaks of dreams deferred,
of battles fought in rooms no one sees.
And I wonder if he knows
he deserves a chance to ease,
to not take the hit,

With me being the safety net this time.
Thank you for having my back, brother.

        <h2>When Winds Speak</h2>
        <p> Fierce winds engrave the sky with grace.
 A vortex of chaos, relentless in its chase.
 Majestic in its fury, the air and debris dance,
 Pulling lightning to the core — you only have one chance.
 Sheer wonder turns to ruin in the blink of an eye,
 A town erased beneath a shattered sky.
 After, only silence remains, Destruction has landed.
 The lens caught chaos — unfiltered, candid.</p>

        <h2>Screaming Silence</h2>
        <p> Are promises just words,
 or were they ever meant at all?
 That’s why I started questioning them,
 they taste too much like comfort,
 like reassurance dressed as truth.
 Actions—
 they scream what words only whisper.
 Not in tone,
 not in volume,
 not in pitch,
 but in reflection.
 In what lingers.
 In what’s missing when the moment passes.
 Most were never followed through.
 Some never even spoke.
 Just bandages
 on wounds that never closed,
 still warm, still bleeding—
 still burning for something real.
 And yet,
 I can respect the silence more than a lie.
 Because silence, at least,
 doesn’t pretend to promise.
 It’s a small step forward,
 the one it takes to finally stop pretending.
 It ends up dragging me two steps back,
 but I’ll always respect what’s done
 more than what’s spoken.

        <h2>Poem Title 6</h2>
        <p>Was it giving up, or finally waking up?

We stopped knocking on a door,
a door that never opened.
Not from weakness,
but from wisdom.
We weren’t chosen, just tolerated.
So we let go, not out of defeat,
but because our spirit refused
to starve in waiting.
We moved on—
not because we wanted to,
but because we had to.
We grew in the absence of light.
Learned that persistence
isn’t always the key,
and that’s okay.
We accepted the truth.
And that was bold of us.
A decision well made.
A choice our future selves would be proud of
We have been woken

Was it giving up, or finally waking up?

We stopped knocking on a door, 
a door that never opened.
Not from weakness,
but from wisdom. 

We weren’t chosen, just tolerated. 
So we let go, not out of defeat,
but because our spirit refused
to starve in waiting. 

We moved on— 
not because we wanted to, 
but because we had to. 

We grew in the absence of light.
Learned that persistence
isn’t always the key, 
and that’s okay. 

We accepted the truth. 
And that was bold of us. 
A decision well made. 
A choice our future selves would be proud of

        <h2>Their Dream, My Flight
</h2>
        <p>They were kids who never stopped growing,
traded dreams for hardships in a foreign country,
gave up language, 
gave up comfort,
left behind family,
to build futures they couldn't see.

Parents who worked so hard,
selfless, silent,
sacrificed careers
so we could chase ours.

I see the kid in them still,
hidden behind tired eyes
and hands too full 
with work they loathe,
missing time, but never love.

If they had what I have,
they’d fly ten times higher.
They took the biggest risk,
Now I owe them something beautiful.
